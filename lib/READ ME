Keeping track of items in the cart will be done by setting/saving the count in sharedPrev,
we use this to rebuild the cart when the app terminates. We also set the count in stockInCart[itemID],
this is easier to work with while the app is running.

When removing or adjusting an item, make sure you set and save in sharedPrev, stockInCart[itemID], and sharedPrev StringList.
